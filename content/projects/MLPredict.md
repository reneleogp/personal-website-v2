Gathered a 16,000+ sample dataset through web scraping, implemented two distinct algorithms – a deep neural network with Keras and gradient boosting with Scikit-Learn – achieving a remarkable 90% accuracy. Designed an interactive user interface using Streamlit, allowing users to test the algorithms.
